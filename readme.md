# Magneton

A cookiecutter template for creating transparent, reusable, and customization widgets in computational notebooks. The template is adapted from [react-jupyter-cookiecutter](https://github.com/megagonlabs/react-jupyter-cookiecutter). Widgets embedded within computational notebooks are suitable for iterative data science workfows. However, these widgets lack robust state management capabilities and do not support user-defned customization of the interactive components. Magneton framework bridges these gaps by introducing a built-in interaction history tracker, a state-manager to maintain widget state history, and an action wrapper to enable on-demand customization of operations defined by widget developers.

The above figure provides a brief overview of `Magneton` features (counter clock-wise). (A) User instantiates a graph exploration widget from the notebook. (B) A multiple-coordinated view consisting of a graph schema and corresponding node (top) and relation (bottom) distribution components is displayed. (C) A customized widget displaying node distribution in alphabetic order --- (D) 
  user defines an initialization function `init()` to customize the sort order and passes it as a callback function during widget initialization. (E) User exports the widget state using the `export_data()` accessor function. 

# Getting Started

> Note: This template is not compatible with Jupyter Notebook v7. Specifically, requires `notebook<7` and `ipywidgets<8`

## First-Time Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone this repo with the following commands.

```sh
# Clone the repository from git
git clone git@github.com:rit-git/magneton.git

# cd into cloned repo
cd magneton
```

### 2a. Install dependencies (with pipenv already installed)

Next, install dependencies with the following commands.

> Recommended: use `pipenv` to simplify managing python packages and virtual environments. Read more [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

```sh
# Creates a virtual environment and installs idependencies
pipenv install --dev

# Install javascript dependencies
yarn install # or `npm install`
```

#### 2b. Install dependencies (If you are using Conda)

First, install ``pyenv``:
```sh
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

Then install ``pipenv``:
```sh
pipenv --python=$(conda run which python) --site-packages
```

Then repeat the steps in ``2a``.

### 3. (Optional) Rename your package

To rename your package, simply rename the `src/magneton` directory and replace `name = "magneton"` in `pyproject.toml`. Then, update the entry point and output of the base configuration in `webpack.config.ts` like so:

```ts
/** webpack.config.ts **/
/* ... */
const base: Configuration = {
    entry: "./src/your-package-name"
    /* ... */
    output: {
        /* ... */
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/your-package-name"),
    }
    /* ... */
}
/* ... */
```

Finally, update the `NAME` constant in `src/your-package-name/core/idom_loader.py`.

## Building and Debugging

Use the following command to build the package to `dist`.

> Note that we use yarn/npm to build, which ensures that the JavaScript/TypeScript files are bundled before the python module is built from the `src` folder

```sh
# Build package for deployment
yarn build # or `npm run build`
```

To get started debugging, first run the following command to "install" your package. This creates a symlink to your source, allowing you to make changes that are reflected immediately without requiring a rebuild. Read more on how it works [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs). This only needs to be done once.

```sh
# Install your package locally
pipenv run pip install -e .
```

Run the following command to re-bundle the TypeScript/JavaScript whenever there is a change.

```sh
# Watch files and bundle on change
yarn watch # or `npm run watch`
```

Finally, in a separate shell, start up a Jupyter Notebook instance with the following command and follow the instructions in the terminal to start testing your module in a notebook.

```sh
# Start Jupyter Notebook
pipenv run jupyter notebook
```

## Creating a Widget

Follow these steps to create a widget. Look at `src/widgets/PlaceHolder.py` and `src/widgets/PlaceHolder.tsx` for examples. For these steps, we will assume your widget is called `mywidget`.

### Create source files

Create a `mywidget.py` and a `mywidget.tsx` in `src/widgets` as follows. Note that these files can be placed anywhere, as long as they are exported properly: whenever a new widget is created, add `Export` references in `init.py` and `index.ts` for the respective python and typescript files. 

```
.
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ widgets
        â”œâ”€â”€ mywidget.py
        â””â”€â”€ mywidget.tsx
```

Checkout the implementation of the `PlaceHolder` widget for further details.

## Widget Examples

Once a widget such as the `PlaceHolder` is created, end-users can access and launch the widget as follow:

```python
from magneton import PlaceHolder

widget = PlaceHolder()
widget.show()
```

Following are some more concrete examples of widgets created with `Magneton` and their capabilities:

- Customize using GPT-3/ChatGPT-powered UDFs: {[GPT-3](https://github.com/megagonlabs/magneton-examples/blob/main/notebooks/gpt3-example.ipynb), [ChatGPT](https://github.com/rit-git/magneton-examples/blob/main/notebooks/chatGPT-example.ipynb)}
